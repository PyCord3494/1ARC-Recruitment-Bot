# 1ARC-Recruitment-Bot

This project is for the 1ARC clan on a game called Foxhole.

Purpose:
Users are prompted a message upon joining.
User either responds with "ally" or "join"
Typing ally grants role and mentions them in a channel for that specific role.
Typing "join" prompts them with interview questions in order for them to join the clan & also gives them that corresponding role.
